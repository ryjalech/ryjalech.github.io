<title>User-Friendly Guide to Ioniq6 SE Car Settings</title>
<introduction>
	This guide provides user-friendly descriptions of the Ioniq6 SE features that you can configure through the central screen to modify the car&apos;s behavior. It is intended for Ioniq6 SE owners, to assist you with understanding the settings—what they do, what you can change about them, and where they are located in the car settings menu. This guide does not cover general driving controls, buttons, or settings outside the main central screen. This is not an authoritative or exhaustive guide; for example, it does not cover sound or navigation settings. This guide also does not cover other features in other Ioniq6 trims. The author is not responsible for inaccurate information. For the full list and descriptions, you should refer to the latest official manual from Hyundai.
